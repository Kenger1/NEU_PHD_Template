  abstract = {This paper studies poly-quadratic stability of nonlinear systems represented
	by a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) discrete fuzzy model. A system is poly-quadratically
	stable when its stability can be verified by a parameter dependent
	Lyapunov function. There are already some results in this area. This
	paper, however, presents less conservative results by adopting more
	slack-matrix-variables in the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).
	The parallel distributed compensation (PDC) law is utilized in both
	the analysis and the synthesis problems. The effectiveness of the
	new results in this paper is validated by a simulation example. Copyright

	information concerning system behavior, including estimates of trajectory
	bounds over finite and infinite time intervals. This type of information
	has been ascertained in a systematic manner using the notions of
	finite-time stability and practical stability. In the present paper
	we generalize some of the existing finite-time stability and practical
	stability results for deterministic dynamical systems determined
	by ordinary differential equations to dynamical systems determined
	by an important class of stochastic differential equations. We consider
	two types of stability concepts: finite-time and practical stability
	in the mean and in the mean square. We demonstrate the applicability
	of our results by means of several examples.},

	is then shown. Two applications of the method to industrial processes
